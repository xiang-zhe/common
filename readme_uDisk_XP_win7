4£¬AHCI mode:
	4.1 AHCI for XP,
	for btter performance of the ssd hard disk, i need change the SATA mode from ATA(eg. IDE) to AHCI.
	but xp will blue screen if change the mode directly, so need download AHCI driver first(https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/18521/intel-rapid-storage-technology-ahci-for-windows-xp-for-intel-nuc.html)
	and i found a scripts prepared the driver for AHCI(https://iknow.lenovo.com.cn/detail/dc_C209605.html;https://webdoc.lenovo.com.cn/lenovowsi/cskb/data/2011-06-22/C209605/AHCI_For_XP.rar)
	decompress and replace the driver file using which was downloaded from intel.com, and install.cmd
	install.cmd just was a temporay sulotion to preventing blue scring after changing mode to AHCI; after reboot, there will a new AHCI device was found by system, it will guide you to update driver which was that download from Intel.com.  
	4.2 AHCI for WIN7,
	just changing a value in regedit and rebooting work well.
