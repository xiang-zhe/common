The Little Thoughts of Thinking Machines ----John McCarthy
    Self-consciousness -- Self-consciousness is perhaps the most interesting mental quality to humans. Human self-consciousness involves at least the following:

    1. Facts about the person's body as a physical object. This permits reasoning from facts about bodies in general to one's own. It also permits reasoning from facts about one's own body, e.g. its momentum, to corresponding facts about other physical objects.

    2. The ability to observe one's own mental processes and to form beliefs and wants about them. A person can wish he were smarter or didn't want a cigarette.

    3. Facts about oneself as a having beliefs, wants, etc. among other similar beings.
